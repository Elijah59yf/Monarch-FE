## 📜 Overview

This repository hosts the frontend code for the personal portfolio and blog of **Akinseloyin Elijah Oluwademilade (Monarch)**, a Computer Engineering student at the University of Lagos. The site serves as a digital presence to showcase skills, completed projects, and share insights via a blog.

It features a modern, responsive design with a distinct dark theme accented by gold, and dynamically loads content (blog posts, projects) from a self-hosted Strapi CMS backend.

## 🚀 Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

* A local web server (Apache, Nginx, or a development server like VS Code's Live Server). Apache configured on port 8080 is used in the current setup.
* Running instances of the backend services:
    * **Monarch CMS (Strapi):** Typically running on `http://localhost:1337`. ([Link to your Strapi backend repo])
    * **Monarch Mail Backend:** Typically running on `http://localhost:3000`. ([Link to your Mail backend repo])

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[your-username]/[your-repo-name].git
    cd [your-repo-name]
    ```
2.  **Configure Local Server:** Set up your chosen web server to serve the contents of this repository. For Apache, ensure the Virtual Host configuration points to this directory and listens on the desired port (e.g., 8080).
3.  **Access:** Open your browser and navigate to the local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`). The site should connect to the locally running backend services.

## ☁️ Deployment Architecture

This project utilizes a self-hosted architecture exposed securely via Cloudflare Tunnels:

* **Frontend (`monarch-website`):** Served by Apache locally on port `8080`. Tunneled to `https://monarchdem.me`.
* **CMS API (`monarch-cms`):** Strapi instance running locally on port `1337`. Tunneled to `https://api.monarchdem.me`.
* **Mail API (`monarch-backend`):** Node.js/Express/SendGrid server running locally on port `3000`. Tunneled to `https://mail.monarchdem.me`.

The frontend JavaScript (`script.js`) dynamically selects the correct API endpoints (local or production) based on the `window.location.hostname`.
